    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age=100;
    let age2=age;
    console.log(age,age2)
    age2=200;
    // age=200;
    console.log(age,age2)

    let name='naik';
    let name2=name;
    console.log(name,name2)
    name2='fahad'
    // name='fahad'
    console.log(name,name2)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    let team=players;
    console.log(team,players)
    team[2]='fahad'
    // players[0]='naik'
    console.log(players,team)

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2=players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3=[].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4=[...players]
    team4[0]='helllloo'
    // players[0]='helllloo'
    console.log(team4,players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const captain=person;
    captain.age=99;
    console.log(person,captain)

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2=Object.assign({},person)
    console.log(person,captain2)
    captain2.age=12;
    captain2.num=300;

    const captain3=Object.assign({},person,{age:20, num:400})

    console.log(person,captain2,captain3)


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
